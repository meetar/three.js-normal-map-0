three.js-normal-map-0
=====================

A demo of a normal map in three.js, showing some problems and solutions:

- [With no normal texture, showing twisted normals](http://meetar.github.io/three.js-normal-map-0/index.html)

I asked this question:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17453298/twisted-normals-with-the-three-js-normal-shader-r-58

- [With a flat normal texture, and normal scale set to 0, showing correct normals:](http://meetar.github.io/three.js-normal-map-0/index2.html)

- [Including a displacement map, showing normals that are still flat:](http://meetar.github.io/three.js-normal-map-0/index3.html)

I asked this question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17528878/compute-normals-from-displacement-map-in-three-js-r-58

- [With an experimental method of recalculating normals post-displacement (not working):](http://meetar.github.io/three.js-normal-map-0/index4.html)
